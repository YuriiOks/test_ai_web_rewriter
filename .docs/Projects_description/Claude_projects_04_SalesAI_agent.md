# **Deep Dive: SaleSphereAI Multi-Agent System**

## **Strategic Interview Framing**

This is your **strongest business impact story**—a real startup with paying customers showing measurable ROI. Frame it as:
1. Architecting for reliability (webhooks can't fail)
2. Multi-agent design patterns (Router/Worker separation)
3. Human-in-the-loop systems (intelligent escalation)
4. Quantifiable business metrics (200% conversion increase)

---

## **📊 Complete Project Specification**

### **Business Context**

**The Problem:**
Small business sellers on Russian marketplaces (Avito, similar to eBay/Craigslist) receive 50-200 customer messages daily across multiple platforms. Average response time: 90 seconds to 2 hours. Each delayed response = lost sale. Sellers spend 4-6 hours/day answering repetitive questions: "Is this in stock?" "Can you deliver to Moscow?" "What's your best price?"

**The Opportunity:**
Automating 70-80% of routine queries would:
- Free up 4+ hours/day for sourcing products, marketing
- Reduce response time from 90s to <2s (instant)
- Increase conversion (buyers don't wait → don't leave)
- Enable 24/7 coverage (sellers sleep, bot doesn't)

**Target Market:**
Individual sellers and small businesses (1-5 employees) doing 1M-5M RUB/month ($10K-50K) in revenue. Tech-savvy enough to use Google Sheets, not savvy enough to build automation.

## **🏗️ Architecture: Multi-Service Design**

### **High-Level System Flow**

**Webhook arrives from Avito → Backend validates & queues → Worker processes → Response sent back to Avito**

### **Why Microservices Architecture?**

| Concern | Monolithic Approach | Microservices Approach (Our Choice) |
|---------|-------------------|----------------------------------|
| **Webhook Timeouts** | Avito times out in 3s if no 200 OK → messages lost | Instant 200 OK, process async → zero lost messages |
| **Scaling** | Vertical scaling only (bigger server) | Horizontal scaling (add workers) |
| **Failure Isolation** | One crash = entire system down | Worker crash doesn't affect webhook receiver |
| **Development** | All code in one repo, hard to test components | Each service independently testable |
| **Deployment** | All-or-nothing deploys, risky | Deploy services independently, safer rollouts |

---

## **🎯 Core Technical Decisions**

### **Decision 1: Redis Queue vs Async Tasks**

**The Constraint:** Avito webhooks timeout in 3 seconds. LLM calls take 2-5 seconds (unpredictable).

**Options Evaluated:**

| Approach | Pros | Cons | Verdict |
|----------|------|------|---------|
| **Sync Processing** | Simple, one code path | Webhooks timeout → messages lost | ❌ Unacceptable |
| **FastAPI Background Tasks** | Built-in, no extra infra | No persistence (server restart = lost jobs) | ❌ Too risky |
| **Celery + RabbitMQ** | Battle-tested, feature-rich | Heavy (2 extra services), complex setup | ❌ Over-engineering |
| **Redis Queue** | Persistent, lightweight, simple API | Manual worker management | ✅ **Chosen** |

**Implementation:**

**Webhook Endpoint (Instant Response):**
```text
Avito sends POST to /webhook/avito
↓
Backend validates signature (Avito auth)
↓
Backend pushes job to Redis: {message_id, seller_id, customer_id, text, timestamp}
↓
Returns 200 OK (elapsed time: 50-100ms)
↓
Avito marks message as delivered
```

**Worker Process (Async Processing):**
```text
Worker polls Redis every 500ms
↓
Job found: {message_id: "abc123", text: "Is this in stock?"}
↓
Router Agent classifies intent: "stock_inquiry"
↓
Calls Stock Agent with product_id + inventory_db
↓
Stock Agent: SELECT quantity FROM inventory WHERE product_id = X
↓
Generates response: "Yes, we have 3 units available!"
↓
Sends via Avito API: POST /messages/{message_id}/reply
↓
Marks job complete in Redis
```

**Result:**
- Zero webhook timeouts (100% message capture)
- Average user-perceived latency: 1.8 seconds (webhook → response in chat)
- Scalable: Add more workers if volume increases

---

### **Decision 2: Multi-Agent Router/Worker Pattern**

**The Problem:** One monolithic agent handling all queries → confusion, low accuracy.

**Example Failure with Monolithic Agent:**
```text
Customer: "Do you have this in blue, and can you ship to Siberia?"
Monolithic Agent: "Yes, we ship everywhere!" (Didn't check stock color)
→ Customer orders → Seller doesn't have blue → Refund/bad review
```

**Solution: Specialized Agents**

**Router Agent:**
- Input: Raw customer message
- Output: Intent classification + extracted entities
- LLM Prompt: "Classify intent: stock_inquiry | delivery_question | price_negotiation | complaint | other. Extract: product_name, location, desired_price."

**Specialist Agents:**
- **Stock Agent:** Access to inventory (Google Sheets in MVP)
- **Delivery Agent:** Access to shipping cost table by region
- **Pricing Agent:** Access to min/max price rules
- **General Agent:** Fallback for casual chat ("Thank you!", "When are you open?")

**Flow:**
```text
Message: "Do you deliver to Novosibirsk?"
↓
Router: intent=delivery_question, location=Novosibirsk
↓
Routes to Delivery Agent
↓
Delivery Agent: Looks up Novosibirsk in shipping table → 500 RUB, 5-7 days
↓
Response: "Yes! Delivery to Novosibirsk costs 500 RUB and takes 5-7 days."
```

**Why This Works:**
- Each agent has narrow scope → better accuracy
- Agents can be improved independently
- Clear debugging (which agent made the mistake?)
- Can A/B test different prompts per agent

---

### **Decision 3: Human Handoff with Confidence Thresholds**

**The Constraint:** Full automation fails on edge cases. Need graceful degradation.

**Handoff Triggers:**

| Trigger | Example | Action |
|---------|---------|--------|
| **Low Confidence** | Router: 0.65 confidence (threshold: 0.80) | Escalate |
| **Ambiguous Intent** | "What about that thing we discussed?" | Escalate |
| **Complex Multi-Part** | "Can I get discount if I buy 10, and ship to 3 addresses?" | Escalate |
| **Complaint/Negative** | "This is broken, I want refund!" | Escalate immediately |
| **Explicit Request** | "Can I talk to a human?" | Escalate |

**Escalation Flow:**
```text
Agent detects low confidence
↓
Sends to customer: "Let me connect you with our team—they'll respond shortly!"
↓
Telegram bot sends to seller:
    "⚠️ Customer needs help
    Customer: Ivan P. (telegram.me/ivanp123)
    Question: [original message]
    Context: [last 3 messages]
    Link: [direct link to Avito chat]"
↓
Seller clicks link → responds directly on Avito
↓
System learns: Logs conversation for future training
```

**Result:**
- 80% autonomous (agent handles without escalation)
- 20% escalated (human takes over)
- Customers feel "heard" (not talking to dumb bot)
- Sellers trust system (it escalates when unsure)

---

## **📈 Technical Challenges & Solutions**

### **Challenge 1: Google Sheets as Inventory Database**

**Why Google Sheets for MVP?**
- Sellers already use Sheets (no training needed)
- Real-time sync (seller updates stock → agent sees instantly)
- No database setup/migration from existing workflow

**The Problem: Rate Limits**
- Google Sheets API: 100 requests per 100 seconds per user
- Peak traffic: 50 messages/minute → 50 stock lookups → rate limit hit

**Solution: Redis Caching Layer**
```text
Stock lookup request comes in
↓
Check Redis cache: GET inventory:product_123
↓
If found: Return cached value (age < 5 minutes)
↓
If not found:
    → Call Google Sheets API
    → Store in Redis: SET inventory:product_123 {qty: 5} EX 300
    → Return value
```

**Result:**
- 80% cache hit rate (most queries repeat within 5 min)
- API calls reduced from 50/min to 10/min
- Under rate limit, no throttling

**Trade-off Accepted:**
- Inventory data may be 0-5 minutes stale
- Acceptable: Seller updates stock → customers see update within 5 min
- Alternative (real-time) would require Postgres → breaking seller workflow

---

### **Challenge 2: Intent Classification Accuracy**

**Initial Performance:**
- Custom prompt with 10 examples: 70% accuracy
- Errors: "Do you have blue?" classified as delivery_question (wrong)

**Root Cause:** Not enough examples in prompt (few-shot learning insufficient)

**Solution: Iterative Prompt Improvement**
1. **Collected 100 real customer messages** from beta testers
2. **Manually labeled** each with correct intent
3. **Added top 20 diverse examples** to prompt
4. **Tested on 50-message validation set**

**Results:**
- Initial: 70% accuracy (35/50 correct)
- After adding examples: 88% accuracy (44/50 correct)
- After refining edge case handling: 95% accuracy (47/50 correct)

**Key Learning:** Quality examples > quantity. One "tricky" example (e.g., sarcasm) teaches more than 5 straightforward ones.

---

### **Challenge 3: Context Loss Between Messages**

**Problem:** Customer sends multi-message queries:
```text
Customer: "Do you have the red backpack?"
Bot: "Yes, 2 in stock!"
Customer: "How much?" (implicit reference to backpack)
Bot: "How much for what?" (lost context)
```

**Solution: Conversation State Management**
```text
Redis stores conversation context:
    Key: conversation:{seller_id}:{customer_id}
    Value: {
        last_product_discussed: "red backpack",
        last_intent: "stock_inquiry",
        timestamp: 1234567890
    }
    TTL: 3600 (1 hour)

When processing "How much?":
    → Retrieve context
    → Expand query: "How much for red backpack?"
    → Route to Pricing Agent with product context
```

**Result:** Context-aware responses, natural conversation flow.

---

## **🎯 Interview Defense: Key Questions**

### **Q: "200% conversion increase—prove it's causal, not correlation."**

**Answer:**
"Fair skepticism. Here's how we validated causality:

**1. Before/After on Same Sellers:**
We didn't compare different sellers. Same 3 sellers, measured 2 months before deployment vs 2 months after. Controlled for:
- Same products
- Same season (all measured Jan-Apr 2024, consistent demand)
- Same marketing spend (sellers confirmed no changes)

**2. Immediate Effect:**
Conversion jumped within first week:
- Week 1 pre-deployment: 4.2% average
- Week 1 post-deployment: 9.8% average
- If it were external factors (seasonality, marketing), we'd see gradual change, not step function.

**3. Seller Attribution:**
When asked directly, sellers said: 'We're responding instantly now, customers don't abandon chats.' Qualitative but consistent across 3 independent sellers.

**4. What I'd Do Differently:**
Ideally, run A/B test: 50% of messages handled by bot, 50% by human. Measure conversion on both. We didn't have volume for statistical significance (would need 1000+ messages per group). With only 3 beta clients, before/after was the best design.

**Limitation I Acknowledge:**
Small sample size (n=3 sellers). Could be luck. To prove at scale, I'd need 50+ sellers with A/B testing. But for MVP validation, the signal was strong enough to justify continued development."

### **Q: "Why Redis over a proper message queue like RabbitMQ or Kafka?"**

**Answer:**
"Context matters. Let me compare options:

**RabbitMQ:**
- Pros: Mature, durable, ack/nack semantics, dead letter queues
- Cons: Requires separate service, complex setup, overkill for our volume

**Kafka:**
- Pros: High throughput, event replay, partitioning
- Cons: Massive overkill (we have 50 msg/min, not 50K), complex ops

**Redis:**
- Pros: We already had Redis for caching, lightweight, persistent (AOF enabled), simple API
- Cons: Less feature-rich than RabbitMQ, no native dead letter queue

**Decision Factors:**
1. **Volume:** 50 messages/minute peak → Redis lists handle this easily
2. **Ops Complexity:** Adding RabbitMQ means 2 more containers, monitoring, failure modes
3. **Startup Budget:** Minimize infrastructure costs (Redis: free tier vs RabbitMQ: $20/mo)

**Trade-off Accepted:**
If we scaled to 10,000 sellers (500K msg/day), I'd migrate to RabbitMQ. For 3 beta sellers, Redis was right-sized.

**How I'd Explain This to Founder:**
'Redis gets us to 100 sellers. If we hit that scale problem, it's a good problem—we're profitable and can afford better infrastructure.'"

---

### **Q: "Google Sheets as a database—isn't that a hack?"**

**Answer:**
"It's a deliberate **product decision disguised as a technical decision**.

**The User Workflow:**
Sellers already manage inventory in Sheets:
```text
| Product    | SKU  | Quantity | Price |
|------------|------|----------|-------|
| Red Bag    | RB01 | 5        | 1500  |
| Blue Bag   | BB01 | 0        | 1600  |
```

**Alternative 1: Migrate to Postgres**
- We build admin panel for inventory management
- Sellers have to learn new tool, duplicate data entry
- Adoption friction: 'Why can't I just use my spreadsheet?'
- Migration complexity: Export Sheets → Import to DB

**Alternative 2: Integrate with Sheets**
- Zero learning curve (they already know Sheets)
- Zero migration (read directly from their existing file)
- Instant adoption: 'It just works with what I have!'

**Technical Cost:**
- Rate limiting → solved with caching (5-min TTL)
- Data validation → accept imperfect data, handle gracefully
- Latency → 200ms lookup (acceptable for messaging use case)

**Product Win:**
All 3 beta sellers said: 'I love that I don't have to change my workflow.'

**When I'd Use Postgres:**
If sellers wanted features Sheets can't do:
- Transaction history tracking (Sheets isn't ACID)
- Complex queries (Sheets API is slow for joins)
- Multi-user conflict resolution

For MVP, Sheets was the **right constraint**—it forced us to meet users where they are."

### **Q: "What was your specific contribution vs the founder?"**

**Answer:**
"I wore two hats: architect and lead engineer.

**My Responsibilities:**
1. **System Architecture:**
   - Designed the Router/Worker multi-agent pattern
   - Chose Redis queue for webhook decoupling
   - Specified Telegram fallback mechanism

2. **Implementation:**
   - Built the FastAPI backend (webhook receiver, agent orchestration)
   - Implemented Redis queue workers
   - Integrated Google Sheets API with caching layer
   - Set up Telegram bot for human escalation

3. **LLM Engineering:**
   - Wrote all agent prompts (Router, Stock, Delivery, Pricing)
   - Tuned intent classification (70% → 95% accuracy)
   - Designed few-shot examples for prompts

**Founder's Responsibilities:**
1. **Business:**
   - Customer acquisition (found 3 beta sellers)
   - Pricing strategy (500 RUB/month subscription)
   - Product roadmap (which features to prioritize)

2. **Domain Expertise:**
   - Explained Avito platform mechanics
   - Provided sample customer messages for prompt training
   - Validated agent responses ('Would a real seller say this?')

**Collaboration Pattern:**
- Weekly sync: I presented technical options, he decided based on customer feedback
- Example: 'Should we support VK (another platform)?' → I estimated 2 weeks dev → He said 'Not yet, let's nail Avito first'

**Key Architectural Decision I Owned:**
The Redis queue decoupling was my call. Founder said 'Can't we just use async?' I explained webhook timeout risk, drew diagram on whiteboard, he agreed. That decision was critical—zero messages lost in 6 months of operation."

---

## **🔥 The "Wow" Moment to Tell**

**The Story:** First Week in Production

"We deployed to first beta seller on a Friday afternoon. I'm monitoring logs remotely. Saturday morning, 6 AM—I wake up to 50 Telegram notifications.

My heart sinks: 'System crashed?'

Open logs. No errors. What's happening?

Turns out: The seller went to sleep at midnight. Bot kept running. Customer in Vladivostok (9 hours ahead) sent message at 3 AM Moscow time: 'Do you ship to Vladivostok?'

Bot responded in 1.8 seconds: 'Yes! 900 RUB, 7-10 days.'

Customer replied: 'Great, I'll take it.'

Bot escalated (order placement requires human). Telegram notified seller's phone (he silenced it overnight).

Seller wakes up Saturday, sees the order, confirms via Avito.

He messages me: 'This just paid for a month of your service. I've NEVER made a sale while I was asleep.'

That's when I knew: We built something that changes the game. Not just automation—it's 24/7 sales capacity for small businesses who couldn't afford it before."
