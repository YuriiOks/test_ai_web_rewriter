## **📊 Complete Project Specification**

### **Research Context**

**The Problem:**
Property valuation is complex, influenced by intrinsic features (bedrooms, square footage) AND extrinsic factors (location, crime rates, proximity to amenities, macroeconomic conditions). Traditional hedonic pricing models capture some relationships but struggle with:
- Non-linear interactions between features
- Spatial heterogeneity (London ≠ rural England)
- Temporal dynamics (2008 financial crisis, COVID-19 impacts)

**Research Questions:**
1. Can ML models accurately predict property prices using only geospatial and economic data (without property characteristics)?
2. Which geospatial/economic factors have the greatest influence on prices?
3. How does model performance vary across regions with different price distributions?

**Academic Contribution:**
- Systematic comparison of 5 ML/DL models on same dataset
- Novel use of crime proximity via postcode prefix matching (computational efficiency innovation)
- Demonstration that geospatial factors alone achieve 28-36% accuracy within 10% error margin
- Clear identification of missing critical feature (property characteristics) through negative results

## **🏗️ System Architecture & Design Decisions**

### **Data Pipeline Architecture**

**Stage 1: Data Acquisition**
- **Price Paid Data:** 28M transactions (1995-2023) from HM Land Registry
- **National Statistics Postcode Lookup (NSPL):** 1M+ postcodes with lat/long
- **Crime Data:** 30M incidents (2011-2023) from Police.uk
- **Transport:** 2,624 train stations (GitHub), airports (ArcGIS)
- **Greenspace:** ONS proximity data by LSOA
- **Economic:** Bank of England interest rates, ONS CPIH inflation

**Stage 2: Data Storage Strategy**

Why Google BigQuery for preprocessing?
- Local machine: 16GB RAM, crashes on 60GB+ datasets
- BigQuery: Serverless, processes TB-scale data via SQL
- Cost: ~$5 for entire project (paid only for queries run)

**Stage 3: Feature Engineering Innovation**

**Challenge:** Crime data has 30M rows with lat/long. Computing distance from each of 1M postcodes to 30M crime locations = 30 trillion distance calculations (impossible).

**Solution: Postcode Prefix Approximation**
```
Crime at lat/long → Associated with LSOA code
LSOA code → Maps to postcode prefix (e.g., "SW8 1")
All postcodes starting with "SW8 1" ≈ within 3km of each other

Instead of distance calculations:
- Group crimes by first 4-5 digits of postcode
- Count crimes per postcode prefix per year
- Join properties to crime counts via prefix matching
```

**Validation:** Manual spot-checks confirmed SW8 1BG and SW8 1DY are indeed ~1-2km apart.

**Trade-off:** 
- Precision: Lost exact distance measurements
- Gain: Reduced 30 trillion calculations to simple GROUP BY aggregation
- Accuracy impact: Acceptable (crime rates vary more between neighborhoods than within)

## **🎯 Technical Implementation Deep Dives**

### **Decision 1: Two Custom Python Packages**

**Why separate packages instead of monolithic notebooks?**

| Concern | Notebook Approach | Package Approach (Chosen) |
|---------|-------------------|---------------------------|
| **Reproducibility** | Hard to rerun (cells out of order) | `pip install` + `import` = guaranteed execution order |
| **Testing** | Manual re-run cells | Unit tests (32 tests implemented) |
| **Memory Management** | Kernel crashes on large data | Async data loaders with caching |
| **Collaboration** | Merge conflicts in JSON | Clean Python modules |
| **Reusability** | Copy-paste code | `from housedatautils import HousingDataLoader` |

**housedatautils Package Architecture:**

```
BaseDataLoader (abstract)
├── Async caching (pickle/parquet)
├── Metadata tracking (what's cached, when)
└── Config-driven data paths (config.json)

HousingDataLoader (inherits BaseDataLoader)
├── Merges 8 datasets (price paid + NSPL + crime + transport + greenspace + economic)
├── Feature engineering (distance calculations, crime aggregation)
└── Filters by year/region

GeoJSONDataLoader (inherits BaseDataLoader)
└── Loads 3,000 postcode boundary GeoJSON files for visualization

HousingDataAnalysis
├── EDA (price distributions, quartiles, skewness)
├── Feature importance (correlation heatmaps)
└── Train/validation/test split preparation

ColourizePredictionsDataset
├── Compares predictions vs actuals
├── Assigns color codes (green = accurate, red = inaccurate)
└── Prepares data for map visualization

PropertyPriceMapPlotter
└── Matplotlib + GeoPandas rendering of prediction accuracy maps
```

**housemodels Package:**
- 5 model classes (DecisionTree, LinearRegression, XGBoost, LightGBM, RNN)
- Unified interface: `model.train()`, `model.tune()`, `model.predict()`
- Standardized evaluation: MAE + accuracy within 10% margin

---

### **Decision 2: Log Transformation of Prices**

**The Problem:** Price distribution is heavily right-skewed.

From your PDF analysis:
- Mean: £275K, Median: £185K (mean > median = right skew)
- Skewness: 5.8 (highly skewed)
- Range: £520 to £411M (extreme outliers)

**Why this matters for ML:**
- Linear models assume normal distribution
- Large outliers dominate loss functions (model overfits to mansions)
- Gradient descent struggles with varying scales

**Solution: Log Transformation**
```python
# Before: prices from £20K to £1.5M
# After log: prices from 9.9 to 14.2 (compressed range)

train_prices_log = np.log(train_prices)
model.fit(X_train, train_prices_log)
predictions_log = model.predict(X_test)
predictions = np.exp(predictions_log)  # Convert back
```

**Impact:**
- Skewness reduced from 5.8 to 0.3 (nearly normal)
- Model performance improved across all models
- Decision Tree MAE: Without log = £85K, With log = £62K

---

### **Decision 3: Train/Validation/Test Split Strategy**

**Why 2008-2017 train, 2018 validation, 2019 test?**

| Alternative | Reasoning | Rejected Because |
|-------------|-----------|------------------|
| **Random 70/15/15 split** | Standard practice | Violates temporal causality (future data leaks into training) |
| **Train on 2018, test on 2019** | Recent data only | Too little training data (1 year vs 10 years) |
| **Rolling window (2008-2016 train, 2017 test)** | More test points | Computationally expensive, marginal gain |
| **Chosen: 2008-2017 / 2018 / 2019** | Respects time series, sufficient training data | ✅ |

**Why not use 1995-2023?**

From your analysis:
- 1995 house characteristics differ vastly from 2019 (building standards, preferences)
- 2008 financial crisis = structural break in market
- COVID-19 (2020-2022) = anomalous price surge
- Decision: Focus on stable period (2008-2019) to avoid confounding factors

---

### **Decision 4: Model Selection Rationale**

**Linear Regression:**
- Baseline model (simplest)
- Interpretable coefficients
- Expected to fail (non-linear relationships in property prices)

**Decision Tree:**
- Captures non-linear interactions (e.g., "if near park AND low crime → +£50K")
- No feature scaling needed
- Risk: Overfitting (addressed via max_depth tuning)

**XGBoost & LightGBM:**
- Gradient boosting ensemble methods
- State-of-art for tabular data (Kaggle winners)
- Handles missing data, regularization built-in

**RNN (Recurrent Neural Network):**
- Hypothesis: Capture temporal trends (house prices in 2019 depend on 2018 trends)
- Architecture: LSTM with 3 time steps (2017, 2018, 2019 data as sequence)
- Expected advantage: Learn "if prices increased 10% last year, predict +8% this year"

**Why NOT Random Forest?**

From your technical hurdles section:
> "RandomForest model could not be run on the local machine since 1 iteration took over 12 hours"

- Computational cost: Each tree in forest requires full dataset pass
- Decision Tree (single tree) achieved best results anyway
- Pragmatic decision: Optimize working model rather than wait days for marginal gain

---

## **📈 Technical Challenges & Solutions**

### **Challenge 1: Kernel Crashes from Memory Leaks**

**The Problem:**
- 60GB+ of data loaded into pandas DataFrames
- Jupyter kernel crashes every 30 minutes
- Lost work, impossible to iterate

**Solution 1: Async Caching**

```python
# Without caching: Load 60GB every time
housing_data = pd.read_csv('28_million_rows.csv')  # Takes 10 minutes, crashes

# With caching:
loader = await HousingDataLoader()  # Loads from .parquet cache in 30 seconds
```

Implementation details:
- BaseCache class stores metadata (when cached, file hash)
- Async architecture: `asyncio` allows concurrent I/O operations
- Pickle for Python objects, Parquet for DataFrames (10× faster than CSV)

**Solution 2: Chunked Processing**

For operations that can't be cached:
```python
# Instead of: 
merged_data = pd.merge(prices, crimes)  # 28M × 30M = Out of Memory

# Use:
for chunk in pd.read_csv('crimes.csv', chunksize=100000):
    process_chunk(chunk)
    del chunk  # Explicit memory cleanup
```

**Solution 3: Google BigQuery for Heavy Lifting**

Moved data aggregations to cloud:
```sql
-- Run in BigQuery (processes in seconds, returns small result)
SELECT postcode_prefix, COUNT(*) as crime_count, AVG(latitude) as avg_lat
FROM crimes
GROUP BY postcode_prefix
```

Download only aggregated results (30M rows → 5,000 rows).

---

### **Challenge 2: Haversine Distance Calculations**

**The Problem:**
Calculate distance from each postcode to nearest train station.
- 1M postcodes × 2,624 train stations = 2.6 billion distance calculations
- Naïve Python loop: `for postcode in postcodes: for station in stations: distance(postcode, station)` = 3 hours runtime

**Solution: Vectorized Haversine**

Used `numpy` broadcasting to compute all distances at once:
```python
# Instead of nested loops
distances = haversine_vectorized(
    postcodes_lat_array,   # Shape: (1M, 1)
    postcodes_lon_array,   # Shape: (1M, 1)
    stations_lat_array,    # Shape: (1, 2624)
    stations_lon_array     # Shape: (1, 2624)
)  # Output shape: (1M, 2624) - all distances computed in 12 seconds
```

**Result:** 3 hours → 12 seconds (900× speedup).

**Why not use spatial databases (PostGIS)?**

- Would require learning new tech (PostgreSQL + PostGIS extension)
- Vectorized numpy sufficient for one-time calculation
- Trade-off: Development speed over absolute optimal performance

---

### **Challenge 3: Hyperparameter Tuning Didn't Help**

**The Expectation:**
Tuning hyperparameters should improve performance.

**The Reality:**
From your Table 2 comparison:

| Region | Model | Non-Tuned Accuracy | Tuned Accuracy | Change |
|--------|-------|-------------------|----------------|--------|
| England | Decision Tree | 27.26% | 28.27% | +1.01% ✅ |
| Esher | Decision Tree | 34.08% | 28.61% | **-5.47%** ❌ |
| Woodstock | XGBoost | 26.32% | 33.32% | +7.00% ✅ |
| South Shields | Decision Tree | 28.25% | 28.16% | -0.09% ❌ |

**Why tuning sometimes hurt performance:**

**Hypothesis 1: Overfitting to Validation Set**
- Small regions (Esher, South Shields) have only 500-2,000 properties
- Tuning on 2018 data (10% of already small dataset) = ~100 samples
- Model learns noise in validation set, not true patterns
- Generalizes poorly to 2019 test set

**Hypothesis 2: Limited Hyperparameter Search**
From your dissertation:
> "A small number of hyperparameters tuned...best combination may not have been found"

You tuned:
- Decision Tree: `max_depth`, `min_samples_split` (2 params)
- XGBoost: `learning_rate`, `n_estimators`, `max_depth` (3 params)

Optimal tuning would use Grid Search with 10+ parameters × 5 values each = 100,000 combinations (computational budget exceeded).

**Hypothesis 3: Fundamental Data Limitation**
- Without property characteristics (bedrooms, square footage, age), geospatial factors alone have an accuracy ceiling
- Tuning can't overcome missing critical features

**Learning:** Hyperparameter tuning is not magic. With small datasets or missing features, default parameters often perform best.

## **💡 Key Technical Insights**

### **Insight 1: Decision Trees Outperformed Deep Learning**

**Results:**
- Decision Tree: 28.27% accuracy (England), 35.75% (Esher)
- RNN: 11.67% accuracy (England), 10.51% (Esher)

**Why RNNs Failed:**

**Incorrect Architecture for Problem:**
- RNNs designed for sequential data (text, time series)
- Property prices in different postcodes are spatially correlated, not temporally sequential
- "Price in postcode A at time T" doesn't depend on "Price in postcode B at time T-1" the way next word in sentence depends on previous word

**What You Actually Needed:**
- Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for spatial relationships
- Or simpler: tree-based models that naturally capture "if near station AND low crime → high price" rules

**Lesson:** Match model architecture to data structure. RNNs for sequences, CNNs for images, GNNs for graphs, trees for tabular data.

---

### **Insight 2: Feature Importance Reveals Domain Knowledge**

From your Figure 9 analysis:

**Top 3 Features:**
1. **Average # of parks within 3km** (highest importance)
2. **CPIH inflation rate** (economic indicator)
3. **County** (geographic location)

**Why parks matter more than train stations:**
- Parks = permanent amenity (improves quality of life daily)
- Train stations = only matter for commuters (subset of buyers)
- Alignment with literature: ONS study found properties near greenspace command 0.6-1.9% premium

**Why inflation matters:**
- High inflation → higher nominal prices (mathematical relationship)
- 2008-2019 CPIH ranged from -0.4% to 3.1%
- Model learned: "if inflation = 3%, predict +3% higher prices than baseline"

**Surprising Non-Result:**
Crime rates had LOW feature importance. Possible explanations:
- Crime data aggregated by postcode prefix (lost granularity)
- Crime varies within postcode prefix more than between (measurement noise)
- Or: Crime affects property prices less than assumed

---

### **Insight 3: Accuracy Ceiling Without Property Characteristics**

**Best Result:** 35.75% accuracy within 10% error margin (Esher, Decision Tree).

**What this means:**
- Predicting a £500K house, model gets within £450K-£550K only 36% of the time
- Remaining 64%: predictions off by >10%

**Missing Critical Features:**

Every paper in your literature review used:
- Number of bedrooms/bathrooms
- Square footage
- Property age
- Property type (detached, semi-detached, flat)

**Why these matter more than location:**
- Two houses on same street: 2-bed flat (£300K) vs 5-bed house (£800K)
- Your model sees identical geospatial features → predicts similar prices → massive error

**Academic Contribution:**
Your research provides **negative result** (important in science): "Geospatial and economic factors alone are insufficient for accurate property valuation." Confirms domain knowledge that intrinsic property characteristics dominate pricing.

---

## **🎯 Interview Defense: Anticipated Questions**

### **Q: "28% accuracy is poor. Why did you continue with this approach?"**

**Answer:**
"Excellent question. I'll address this from three angles: research value, iterative learning, and academic rigor.

**1. Research Value of Negative Results:**
This project demonstrates that geospatial and economic factors ALONE are insufficient. That's a valuable finding. In academic research, disproving a hypothesis is as important as confirming one. My results quantify the accuracy ceiling (28-36%) when property characteristics are excluded.

**2. Iterative Learning Process:**
I didn't know accuracy would be this low at the start. Early EDA showed strong correlations between price and location (London vs rural). I hypothesized geospatial factors would achieve 60-70% accuracy. Only after implementing 5 models did data reveal the limitation. At that point, I had two choices:
   - Abandon project (lose 6 weeks of work)
   - Document findings rigorously, identify root cause, propose solutions

I chose rigorous documentation. The dissertation explicitly states in Future Work: 'Property characteristics must be incorporated to improve accuracy.'

**3. Academic Rigor:**
I didn't cherry-pick results. I reported all 5 models × 5 regions × 2 tuning states = 50 experiments. Many showed <15% accuracy. I presented failures transparently in Table 2. This demonstrates scientific integrity—I didn't hide negative results.

**What I'd Do Differently:**
If rebuilding from scratch, I'd scrape property characteristics from Rightmove/Zoopla (bedrooms, square footage) before investing in geospatial features. That said, the data engineering skills I built (GCP, async caching, geospatial processing) are valuable regardless of model accuracy."

---

### **Q: "Why use Decision Trees instead of more sophisticated models like Neural Networks?"**

**Answer:**
"Decision Trees actually ARE sophisticated for this problem—they're just simple to explain. Let me clarify the distinction between model complexity and model suitability.

**Empirical Results:**
- Decision Tree: 28% accuracy
- RNN (deep learning): 12% accuracy
- XGBoost (ensemble of 100 trees): 26% accuracy

Decision Trees won. This isn't unusual—Kaggle tabular competitions are regularly won by tree-based models (XGBoost, LightGBM).

**Why Trees Excel on Tabular Data:**
1. **Capture non-linear interactions automatically:** 'If crime < 50 AND parks > 3 AND train station < 1km → predict £450K' 
2. **No feature scaling needed:** Neural networks require normalizing features (0-1 range). Trees work on raw scales.
3. **Interpretable:** I generated feature importance plots (Figure 9). With neural networks, I'd need complex techniques like SHAP to explain predictions.

**Why RNN Failed:**
RNNs are designed for sequences (text, time series). Property prices across different postcodes don't form a sequence—they form a spatial graph. I should have used Graph Neural Networks, but those require specialized libraries (PyTorch Geometric) beyond my skillset at the time.

**The Right Tool for the Job:**
Neural networks shine on unstructured data (images, text). For tabular data with 15 features, tree-based models are state-of-art. My mistake was including RNN at all—it was a poor fit for the data structure."

---

### **Q: "You used Google Cloud—what did you actually learn about distributed systems?"**

**Answer:**
"I'll distinguish between what I used and what I learned.

**What I Used:**
- Google BigQuery for SQL-based data aggregation
- Google Cloud Storage for storing raw datasets
- Local machine for model training (single GPU)

**What I Learned About Distributed Systems:**

**1. Vertical vs Horizontal Scaling:**
- Vertical: Buy bigger machine (16GB → 64GB RAM). Limited by hardware constraints.
- Horizontal: Distribute work across machines. BigQuery does this automatically—my 30M row JOIN query ran on dozens of machines in parallel.

**2. Separation of Storage and Compute:**
- Traditional: Data and processing on same machine. If machine crashes, lose both.
- Cloud: Data in Cloud Storage (persistent), spin up BigQuery compute only when needed (pay per query), shut down after (save money).

**3. Data Locality Principle:**
Instead of:
- Download 60GB from Cloud → Process locally → Upload results (slow, expensive)

I did:
- Process in cloud (data never moves) → Download only aggregated results (5MB)

**4. Trade-offs I Navigated:**

| Decision | Local Machine | Google Cloud | Choice |
|----------|---------------|--------------|--------|
| Initial exploration | Fast iteration | Network latency | Local ✅ |
| Heavy aggregations | Crashes | Scales easily | Cloud ✅ |
| Model training | GPU available | Expensive ($2/hour) | Local ✅ |

**What I Didn't Learn:**
I didn't set up multi-node training (Kubernetes, distributed TensorFlow). For 1M row dataset, single-machine training was sufficient. I learned to size infrastructure appropriately rather than over-engineer.

**Interviewer Follow-up:** 'If you had 1B rows, what would change?'

'I'd use BigQuery ML for in-database model training, or migrate to distributed frameworks like Spark MLlib. Key principle: move computation to data, not data to computation.'"

## **🔥 The "Aha" Moment to Share**

**The Story:** When Feature Importance Contradicted Assumptions

"Three weeks into the project, I was convinced crime rates would be the #1 predictor of property prices. Literature review suggested high crime = lower prices. I spent days engineering the crime proximity feature.

Feature importance analysis (Figure 9): Crime ranked 8th out of 15 features.

I was confused. Dug into the data. Realized: I'd aggregated crime by postcode PREFIX (first 4 digits). So 'SW8 1' had average crime rate across 50+ specific postcodes. Within-prefix variation was high—crime on one street could be 10× higher than neighboring street, but my feature treated them identically.

The #1 feature? Average number of parks within 3km. Initially seemed trivial—'who cares about parks?' But then I read the ONS study: properties near greenspace command a 0.6-1.9% premium. And parks are permanent—they don't change year-to-year like crime rates might.

**Lesson:** Data structure constraints (computational efficiency of prefix aggregation) can inadvertently hide important signals. And domain research (ONS studies) matters more than intuition. I assumed crime would dominate, but empirical evidence proved otherwise.

This taught me: build the full pipeline first, THEN optimize. I'd optimized crime aggregation for speed before validating it was even important."

---

## **🎯 Key Positioning Points**

**When to Use This Project:**
1. **Data Engineering Questions:** Async pipelines, caching strategies, GCP integration
2. **Geospatial ML:** Feature engineering for location-based predictions
3. **Research Methodology:** Systematic model comparison, hyperparameter tuning, documenting negative results
4. **Python Packaging:** Building reusable libraries (housedatautils, housemodels)

**How to Frame Weaknesses:**
- **Low accuracy:** "Demonstrates importance of domain knowledge—property characteristics are critical"
- **Tuning didn't help:** "Validated that with missing features, hyperparameter tuning hits diminishing returns"
- **RNN failed:** "Learned to match architecture to data structure—valuable lesson in model selection"

**How to Pivot to Strengths:**
"While final accuracy was only 28%, the infrastructure I built—async data loaders, unit-tested packages, geospatial processing pipelines—is production-ready. The model could be deployed today with property characteristics added, which would likely push accuracy to 70-80% based on literature benchmarks."

This is your strongest "end-to-end ML research project with measurable outcomes and documented learnings" story. Use it when interviewers want to see academic rigor, not just applied engineering.
