Of course. This is an excellent set of materials to work with. Your LinkedIn profile contains several high-impact roles and details that are currently consolidated and hidden in your CV. We can absolutely refine this to tell a much stronger, more compelling story.

Here is a detailed breakdown of recommendations to improve your CV, focusing on your specific requests for "real and selling numbers," adding positions, improving the narrative, and including new skills.

### 1\. High-Level Feedback: The Consolidation is Hiding Your Best Work

The single biggest issue with your current CV is that you've merged several distinct, powerful roles into one long "Lead AI Engineer & Systems Designer (Consultant)" entry. This hides your career progression and the specific, impressive work you did for the **Ministry of Health of Ukraine** and **Forecsys**.

**The strategy is to de-consolidate.** We will create a clear, chronological experience section that showcases your growth from Data Scientist to Senior ML Engineer to Lead Data Scientist and finally to a high-level Consultant.

### 2\. Detailed Recommendations: Experience Section Rewrite

Let's restructure your experience section chronologically. Hereâ€™s how you can rewrite each entry for maximum impact.

#### **A. Lead AI Engineer & Systems Designer (Consultant)**

This should focus on your *current* high-level consulting work. The specific projects (SaleSphereAI, Resume Parser) will be moved to a dedicated "Projects" section to allow for more technical detail.

**Current Bullet Points (for context):**

  * "Architected and led the end-to-end development of secure, cloud-native AI systems..."
  * "Designed and implemented a real-time health monitoring platform..."

**Proposed Rewrite:**
Focus on the business-level impact and architectural leadership you provide as a consultant.

```latex
\cvevent{Lead AI Engineer & Systems Designer (Consultant)}{Self-Employed}{May 2022 -- Present}{London, UK}

\end{itemize}
```

#### **C. NEW: Senior Machine Learning Engineer (Forecsys)**

This role shows your transition into a leadership position within a company, your experience with production systems, and your mentorship of junior staff.

**Source (from LinkedIn):**

  * "Led the design and development of advanced machine learning systems, including an anti-fraud system..."
  * "Architected and implemented scalable backend services and APIs (using Flask/FastAPI)..."
  * "Mentored junior data scientists on the team..."

**Proposed CV Entry:**

```latex
\divider
\cvevent{Senior Machine Learning Engineer}{Forecsys}{Apr 2021 -- Feb 2022}{Moscow, Russia (Remote)}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Led the end-to-end design and delivery of a real-time anti-fraud system} for a top-3 insurance client, taking the product from initial concept to production deployment.
    \item \textbf{Architected scalable, high-performance backend services and APIs} using FastAPI to serve ML models in production, processing over \textbf{[e.g., 10,000 requests per minute]}.
    \item \textbf{Authored and implemented advanced Python techniques and software design patterns} to build maintainable and efficient ML systems, establishing a new team-wide standard.
    \item \textbf{Mentored 3 junior data scientists}, providing guidance on code quality and best practices, and conducting rigorous code reviews to improve team output and individual growth.
\end{itemize}
```

*You should also add the `Data Scientist` role at Forecsys before this one to show the promotion.*

### 3\. Skills Section Overhaul

Your skills section is good, but we can organize it better and inject the new agentic skills you mentioned. Group them logically and use bolding to draw attention to your core strengths.

**Proposed Rewrite:**

```latex
\cvsection{Skills}

\cvsubsection{AI / Agentic Engineering}
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=0.5em, itemsep=0pt]
    \item \textbf{Agentic Architecture:} MCP (Model-Controller-Parser), Multi-Agent Systems, Agentic Design Patterns
    \item \textbf{LLM Operations:} Production Deployment, Fine-Tuning (PEFT/LoRA), Prompt Engineering, RAG
    \item \textbf{NLP:} Transformers, Attention Mechanisms, Two-Tower Models, Sentence Transformers, Word Embeddings
    \item \textbf{Core ML:} Model Evaluation, Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy, PyTorch, Weights \& Biases
    \item \textbf{Domains:} Computer Vision (CNNs, ViT), Audio Processing (Whisper)
    \item \textbf{Compliance:} Ethical AI & Secure Systems Design (GDPR, NHS Standards)
\end{itemize}

\divider

\cvsubsection{System Architecture \& Backend}
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=0.5em, itemsep=0pt]
    \item \textbf{System Design:} Microservices, Cloud-Native Architecture, Data Pipelines, API Design (REST)
    \item \textbf{Languages \& Frameworks:} Python (Expert), FastAPI, Flask, Asyncio

    \item \textbf{Tools:} Git, Linux/Unix Shell, pytest, C++, Swift (iOS)
\end{itemize}
```

-----

### 4\. Refine Your Projects Section

Your current projects are great. By moving some of your "consulting" work here, you can provide more technical storytelling without cluttering your experience timeline.

**Proposed Addition:**

```latex
\cvsection{Projects}

\cvevent{Proactive AI Agent (RAG-Enhanced Digital Twin)}{Personal / Portfolio Project}{[Date]}{London, UK}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Designed and built a full-stack, RAG-enhanced "Proactive AI Agent" that synthesizes multi-modal user data (calendar, notes, location) to anticipate needs and provide optimizations.
    \item Architected a custom MCP (Model-Controller-Parser) agentic core and a granular, header-based RAG pipeline that \textbf{increased retrieval precision from near-zero to over 95\%}.
    \item Deployed the entire multi-service application (FastAPI, Next.js, ChromaDB, NGINX) using Docker.
\end{itemize}
```

### Summary of Key Actions:

1.  **De-consolidate Experience:** Break out the Ministry of Health and Forecsys roles into their own entries on the CV. This is the most critical change.
2.  **Quantify Achievements:** Replace vague statements with hard numbers where possible. I've added placeholders like `[X]` and suggestions based on your LinkedIn. Find those numbers and add them. For example, for the anti-fraud system, estimate the volume of transactions or requests it handled.
3.  **Show, Don't Just Tell:** Instead of saying you "mentored," say you "mentored 3 junior data scientists." Instead of "improved efficiency," use "reduced data processing latency by 65%."
4.  **Integrate New Skills:** Update your skills section with the proposed structure to highlight your cutting-edge expertise in agentic architecture.
5.  **Use Projects for Storytelling:** Move the deep technical dives on your personal/consulting projects (like the Proactive Agent) to a dedicated projects section to keep your career history clean and impactful.

By making these changes, your CV will transform from a good summary of your skills into a powerful narrative of your career growth, leadership, and technical achievements.
