# **Yurii Oksamytnyi // My Career Story**
### A Product-Driven Approach to AI Engineering

> I'm a **Senior AI Engineer and Systems Architect** specializing in architecting and delivering production-grade intelligent systems. My career has been a decade-long journey from first-principles mathematics and systems programming to designing the full-stack, AI-native applications that solve core business problems. I believe the most effective solutions emerge from the intersection of deep technical understanding, pragmatic engineering, and a relentless focus on the end-user.

### **Chapter 1: The Foundation - From Chaos Theory to CoreML**

My journey began not with web apps, but with the raw fundamentals. As a teenager, I was fascinated by the mathematics of complex systems, building simulations of non-linear dynamics like the Lorenz attractor in **Delphi**. This taught me to think from first principles.

At university, this evolved into building high-performance software for high-load systems using **C++**, which gave me a deep appreciation for efficiency. While I saw the elegance of **Python**, the industry was focused on mobile, so I dove into **Swift** and iOS development.

I built numerous iOS applications, but I found my passion was not just in connecting interfaces, but in building the *intelligence* within them. The catalyst was a project involving **CoreML** for image recognition. I realized my goal was to build the cognitive core of applications, which prompted my full transition into the world of AI and Machine Learning.

### **Chapter 2: The Architect in Practice - Case Studies in AI System Design**

My philosophy is best demonstrated through the systems I've built. These case studies highlight my approach to solving complex challenges, making critical architectural trade-offs, and delivering high-impact, production-ready AI solutions.

---

#### **Case Study 1: The Proactive AI Personalization Engine**

* **F (First Line Hook):** I designed and deployed a full-stack, RAG-enhanced AI system that functions as a proactive personalization engine, synthesizing a user's multi-modal data to deliver intelligent daily optimizations.

* **A (Add Context):** The initial prompt was open-ended: "build something small that feels good to use" from a dataset of a user's calendar, location, and notes. Through initial data analysis, I identified a recurring theme: technology-induced sleep disruption. The goal became to build a system that could move beyond a reactive chatbot to *anticipate* user needs and proactively help protect their focus and sleep.

* **S (Share Your Action):** I architected and implemented the end-to-end system.
    1.  **Agentic Core:** To maintain full control over the prompt-chain logic and latency, I chose to implement a lightweight, custom **MCP (Model-Controller-Parser)** agent in Python. The **Controller** orchestrates a two-step LLM chain: a fast, low-cost call to **Gemini Flash** for query categorization, followed by a deeper reasoning step with a more powerful model to generate insights.
    2.  **RAG & Memory Pipeline:** I built a RAG pipeline using a `Sentence-Transformer` model and a **ChromaDB** vector store to provide the agent with long-term memory. The initial chunking strategy proved to be a critical failure point, so I re-engineered the ingestion script to implement a more granular, header-based chunking logic.
    3.  **Backend & Data Architecture:** I developed a **FastAPI** backend to serve the agent. A key decision was to separate data concerns: I used **SQLite with SQLAlchemy** for structured, transactional data like decision logs and user preferences, while **ChromaDB** was used for unstructured, semantic knowledge. This separation provides query efficiency and simplifies future data analysis.
    4.  **Interface & Deployment:** I built a real-time UI with **Next.js and TypeScript**. The entire multi-service application was containerized with **Docker** and orchestrated with `docker-compose`. I resolved a startup race condition between services with a custom entrypoint health check script, and the final application was deployed to a live URL, served securely via **NGINX**.

* **T (Tell the Result):** The outcome was a deployed prototype that could proactively suggest a "Smart Notification Shield" to protect sleep, maintain conversational context, and provide full reasoning transparency through a "Knowledge Explorer" UI. The entire project is captured in an 89-commit git history and a comprehensive technical report.

> **Technical Deep Dive: RAG Chunking Strategy**
> **Challenge:** The RAG pipeline initially had a catastrophic <5% retrieval accuracy. Queries for specific details were "drowned out" by the large, semantically broad document chunks from our first-pass ingestion script.
> **Decision:** I evaluated two options: fine-tuning the embedding model or refining the chunking strategy. Given the project's timeline, fine-tuning was too slow. I opted to re-architect the data ingestion pipeline to parse the document structure and create smaller, more focused chunks based on Markdown headers. This decision involved a trade-off: a more complex ingestion script for a vastly improved knowledge base.
> **Outcome:** This change was pivotal, increasing retrieval precision to over 95% and making the agent's responses contextually relevant and genuinely useful.

#### **Case Study 2: The AI Sales Agent (`SaleSphereAI`)**

* **F (First Line Hook):** As the Founding AI Architect for a stealth-mode startup, I designed and led the development of a multi-agent microservices system that automated sales communications, resulting in a 200% increase in conversion rates for our beta clients.

* **A (Add Context):** The business problem was clear: small business owners were overwhelmed by repetitive queries from multiple platforms (Avito, Telegram), leading to slow response times and lost sales. The system needed to centralize communications and provide instant, accurate, 24/7 support.

* **S (Share Your Action):** My role was to design the system architecture and guide the initial implementation.
    1.  **System Architecture:** I proposed a microservices architecture using **FastAPI**, with **PostgreSQL** for persistent storage and **Redis** as a message broker for asynchronous task processing.
    2.  **Multi-Agent Workflow:** Instead of a single monolithic agent, I designed a more robust multi-agent system. A central **"Router Agent"** performs intent classification on incoming messages. Based on the intent (e.g., "stock availability," "delivery options"), it routes the query to a specialized **"Response Agent"** that has access to the relevant tools and data (e.g., inventory database, shipping tables).
    3.  **Human-in-the-Loop:** For reliability, I designed an intelligent fallback mechanism. If an agent's confidence score was low or the user's intent was ambiguous, the system would automatically pause the AI, notify a human manager via a Telegram bot, and provide the full conversation context for a seamless manual takeover.

* **T (Tell the Result):** The MVP was a significant success. It automated over 80% of incoming queries, freeing up hours of our clients' time. For our three initial beta clients, this led to an increase in sales conversion from an average of 4% to 12% over a two-month period.

> **Technical Deep Dive: Ensuring System Responsiveness**
> **Challenge:** We needed to respond to incoming platform webhooks in milliseconds to avoid timeouts, but LLM API calls could take several seconds. A synchronous process would be unreliable and unscalable.
> **Decision:** I implemented a standard, robust solution by decoupling the processes. The incoming webhook endpoint's only job was to validate the request and push a job onto a **Redis** queue, immediately returning a `200 OK`. Separate, scalable worker processes would then consume from this queue to perform the heavy AI processing asynchronously.
> **Outcome:** This design choice made the system incredibly resilient, ensuring we never missed a webhook and could scale the AI processing power independently of the incoming request volume.

#### **Case Study 3: The Resume Parser & Matching Engine**

* **F (First Line Hook):** I architected an enterprise-grade resume parsing and job matching platform for an HR Tech client, delivering an AI engine that reduced their manual screening time by over 75%.
* **A (Add Context):** The client needed to process thousands of CVs in various formats (PDF, DOCX) and accurately match candidates to roles. The key requirements were accuracy, speed, and the ability to handle diverse document layouts.
* **S (Share Your Action):** I designed a full-stack, multi-service system with a clean separation of concerns.
    1.  **AI Services:** The system included a **Document Processing Service** (using PyMuPDF and the Gemini API for hybrid layout analysis), an **NLP Classification Service** (using a fine-tuned Sentence-Transformer for skill extraction), and a **Matching Engine Service**.
    2.  **Backend & Frontend:** A central **FastAPI** backend orchestrated the services. I also built the responsive, multi-lingual, and accessible UI using **Next.js and TypeScript**.
* **T (Tell the Result):** The platform was a major success. The skill classification model achieved a **93% F1 score** on our test set. The end-to-end pipeline could process a new CV and return the top 5 job matches in under 3 seconds, directly contributing to a **75% reduction in time-to-hire** for the client.

> **Technical Deep Dive: The Hybrid Database Strategy**
> **Challenge:** The system needed to support two distinct query types: fast, structured filtering (e.g., "find candidates with 5+ years of Python") and flexible, unstructured storage for the full parsed CV data.
> **Decision:** After evaluating options, I implemented a polyglot persistence strategy. We used **PostgreSQL** for all structured, filterable metadata (skills, experience years, etc.) due to its powerful querying capabilities. For the large, unstructured JSON output from the parsing process, we used **MongoDB**, which offered flexibility and performance for document retrieval.
> **Outcome:** This hybrid approach gave us the best of both worlds: lightning-fast relational queries for the matching engine and a flexible document store for displaying full candidate profiles, at the cost of slightly increased operational complexity.

### **Chapter 3: My Philosophy - The AI-Native Architect**

My engineering approach is guided by several core principles:

1.  **Architect, Then Build.** I believe that thoughtful system design and planning up-front saves weeks of refactoring. My workflow begins with a clear architectural plan, defining services, data models, and milestones before writing production code.
2.  **Pragmatism and Trade-offs.** The goal is always to ship value that solves user problems. I focus on building incrementally, making deliberate technical trade-offs to prioritize momentum and learning over monolithic perfection. The best architecture is the one that effectively solves the problem at hand within the given constraints.
3.  **AI as a Force Multiplier.** I use AI assistants as a partner in my workflow to augment my engineering skills. This means scaffolding new services, generating unit test variations, and accelerating refactoring, which allows me to focus my time on the most critical architectural and product decisions.
4.  **End-to-End Ownership.** I am most effective when I can take ownership of a feature's entire lifecycle. This involves collaborating on initial requirements, architecting the solution, writing the code, and monitoring its performance and business impact in production.
