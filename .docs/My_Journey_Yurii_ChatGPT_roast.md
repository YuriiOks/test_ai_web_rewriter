Alright Yurii — putting on the hat of a **20+ year FAANG AI Engineer reviewing this for interview prep**, here’s a **tough but constructive roast** of your doc script.

## 🔥 High-Level Roast

* **You oversell breadth, undercut depth.**
  You jump from Delphi → C++ → iOS → CoreML → RAG → Resume parsers → Property valuation → multi-agent startups. That reads like a “jack of all trades” rather than a clear “this is my world-class edge.” At FAANG, we want to know: *are you a research-y ML systems person? A large-scale distributed systems engineer? A product-first applied ML builder?* Your narrative blurs them.

* **The "genius solution" trope is dangerous.**
  You use this phrase several times. It sounds defensive and self-congratulatory. In FAANG interviews, the expectation is: *you identified a bottleneck, tried alternatives, benchmarked, and landed on a principled solution.* Not “I hacked in a genius idea.” Replace it with structured *problem → tradeoffs → measured outcome.*

* **Metrics are sometimes unconvincing.**

  * *“200% increase in sales conversion”* — feels like a marketing claim, not a validated experiment. FAANG interviewers will ask: *How was this measured? Was it statistically significant?*
  * *“94% accuracy within 10% error margin”* — vague. Accuracy isn’t meaningful for regression tasks (property prices). Better: *Mean Absolute Error = £X, R² = 0.92*.

* **Risk of "resume theater."**
  The narrative sometimes reads like a startup pitch deck, not like an engineer’s war story. Phrases like *“The Brain (Agentic Core)”* or *“Digital Twin”* are flashy, but FAANG panels will prefer technical clarity: *Controller implemented as async event loop → parallelized embeddings pipeline → resolved race conditions with service-level health checks.*

* **Ownership vs. teamwork.**
  You repeatedly frame things as *“I architected the entire system”*. At FAANG, that risks sounding siloed. They’ll probe: *Who did you work with? Did you mentor? Did you lead tradeoff discussions? Did you write design docs that survived peer review?*

## 🎯 Detailed Roast by Section

### **Chapter 1 (Foundation)**

* Delphi → chaos theory → C++ → iOS → CoreML. Reads as scattershot. Senior FAANG engineers will ask: *What’s the through-line?* Right now, it feels like you kept hopping until something “clicked.” Frame it instead as *progressive depth into systems + intelligence layers.*

### **Case Study 1 (Proactive AI Agent)**

* Cool project, but:

  * **Red flag:** *“Rejected monolithic frameworks like LangChain”* → Why? Interviewer will grill you. Was it perf? Maintainability? What benchmarks?
  * **RAG pipeline fix**: “header-based chunking increased retrieval precision from 0 → 95%.” Sounds made up. How did you evaluate precision? Did you have labeled queries? Was it empirical or anecdotal?
  * Overly detailed UI/NGINX/Docker mention. FAANG doesn’t care unless infra scale was nontrivial.

### **Case Study 2 (Sales Agent)**

* Multi-agent design is solid.
* But *“200% increase in conversions”* screams *“startup hype.”* Without A/B testing, this will be dismissed. Better: “Average response latency dropped from 90s → <2s. This correlated with increased conversions reported by beta users.”

### **Case Study 3 (Resume Parser)**

* Stronger — measurable F1 score and system design.
* But: fine-tuned model details are vague. *What dataset? How did you annotate? How did you avoid overfitting?*
* The “hybrid DB” solution is credible, but again sounds like a buzzword unless you explain the actual query bottlenecks that forced the dual system.

### **Case Study 4 (Property Valuation)**

* *94% accuracy* is misleading for regression. Interviewers will jump on this.
* The caching solution is good — this is the kind of *systems hack* FAANG likes. But emphasize *measured impact (50x runtime reduction)*, not “genius solution.”

### **Chapter 3 (Philosophy)**

* Reads well — but dangerously generic. Every FAANG senior engineer says: *“Architect, ship pragmatically, AI as copilot, end-to-end ownership.”*
* You need a sharper edge: *What’s your differentiator? Are you the “distributed AI systems guy”? The “agent orchestration scaling guy”? The “pragmatic applied ML in messy real-world domains” guy?* Without it, this blends into boilerplate.

## 🚀 How to Sharpen for FAANG Interviews

1. **Pick your superpower.**

   * Systems at scale?
   * Pragmatic applied ML for production?
   * AI-native architecture with RAG/agents?
     Don’t try to be all three at once.

2. **Kill hype, add rigor.**
   Replace *“genius solution”* with:
   *“I experimented with A, B, C. A failed due to latency. B failed due to retrieval precision. C worked — here’s the benchmark.”*

3. **Quantify properly.**

   * Use MAE/R² for regression.
   * Use precision/recall/F1 for classification.
   * Use latency, throughput, infra cost, scaling metrics for systems.
     Not “accuracy” or “200% boost.”

4. **Show collaboration.**
   Mention: design docs, peer reviews, mentoring, tradeoff debates. Otherwise it sounds like a lone wolf portfolio, not someone who thrives in large org engineering cultures.

5. **Balance architecture with *one deep dive*.**
   Pick ONE project where you can go extremely deep in interviews (e.g., your RAG chunking fix). Prepare to talk about exact embeddings, similarity metrics, error cases, test harnesses, latency tradeoffs.

⚡ **Key Takeaway:**
Right now, your doc screams **“startup CTO with hype-y storytelling.”** For FAANG, you want it to scream **“deep systems/ML engineer who builds scalable, production AI.”**

Would you like me to **rewrite your doc in a “FAANG interview ready” style** — stripping the hype, focusing on one or two killer projects, with clean metrics and technical clarity? That way you’d have both the *storytelling version* (startup pitch) and the *interview version* (peer-to-peer engineering).
