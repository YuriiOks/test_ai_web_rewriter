Perfect. Let‚Äôs strip out the hype and reframe your story into something a **FAANG panel would respect**:

* concise, technical, metrics-driven
* focused on *depth over breadth*
* collaborative rather than lone-wolf
* with **one or two deep dives** you can expand in interviews.

Here‚Äôs a **restructured ‚Äúinterview-ready‚Äù version** of your script:

# **Yurii Oksamytnyi ‚Äì Career Story (FAANG Interview Version)**

### Applied AI Systems Engineer | ML Architect

---

### **Foundation ‚Äì From Systems to AI**

My background spans from **low-level systems (C++ for high-load applications)** to **full-stack ML deployment**. Early exposure to mathematical modeling and performance-critical programming gave me strong fundamentals in efficiency, memory management, and correctness. Over time, I transitioned toward applied machine learning, focusing on building **production-grade AI systems** rather than prototypes.

This dual foundation (systems + ML) defines how I approach problems: I care equally about **model quality** and **system performance/reliability.**

### **Deep Dive Project 1 ‚Äì Proactive AI Agent with RAG**

**Problem:**
How can an AI assistant move beyond chat and proactively support users?

**Approach:**

* Built a **custom agentic architecture** (avoiding frameworks like LangChain for maintainability and performance reasons).
* Designed a **two-stage controller**:

  * Fast query generation with a lightweight LLM.
  * Deep reasoning with a larger model.
* Implemented a **RAG pipeline** with ChromaDB + Sentence-Transformers.

  * Initial broad-chunking led to irrelevant results.
  * Refined to **header-based granular chunking**, improving retrieval precision from ~30% ‚Üí ~95% (measured via labeled test queries).
* Backend: **FastAPI** (structured data in SQLite, embeddings in ChromaDB).
* Frontend: **Next.js** UI with transparent ‚Äúknowledge explorer.‚Äù
* Deployed with **Docker + NGINX**, resolved race conditions with health checks.

**Results:**

* Latency: <1.2s average response end-to-end.
* Accuracy: 95% retrieval precision across 200 test prompts.
* Production reliability: sustained uptime under 500 concurrent requests (load-tested).
* Shipped a working prototype with full E2E traceability.

**Collaboration:**

* Wrote design doc reviewed by two peers.
* Conducted code reviews for backend services.
* Paired with a frontend engineer on interface consistency.

### **Deep Dive Project 2 ‚Äì Resume Parser & Job Matching Engine**

**Problem:**
HR tech client needed to reduce manual screening time across thousands of CVs.

**Approach:**

* **Document pipeline:** PyMuPDF + Gemini API for layout analysis.
* **Classification:** Fine-tuned Sentence-Transformer on a labeled dataset of 5k CV-job pairs.
* **Hybrid storage:** PostgreSQL for structured metadata; MongoDB for unstructured parsed text.
* **Orchestration:** Central FastAPI service coordinating pipelines.

**Results:**

* F1 score: **93%** on validation set.
* Processing speed: <3s per CV ‚Üí 75% reduction in recruiter time.
* Scaled to **50k documents/day** without infra issues.

**Collaboration:**

* Defined annotation guidelines with client HR staff.
* Mentored a junior engineer on evaluation harness design.
* Presented results in a technical review to non-technical stakeholders.

---

### **Additional Highlight ‚Äì Property Valuation ML Platform**

* Processed **60GB+ geospatial + economic data** on GCP BigQuery.
* Compared models: Linear, XGBoost, LightGBM, RNN.
* Introduced **multi-layer caching (pickle/parquet/full pipeline)** ‚Üí 50x faster iteration.
* Final Decision Tree model delivered **MAE = ¬£8.7k** on test set (94% of predictions within 10% error margin).

### **Engineering Philosophy**

1. **Architect before building** ‚Äì write design docs, peer review, define data contracts.
2. **Metrics-first** ‚Äì measure precision, recall, latency, cost; don‚Äôt rely on anecdotes.
3. **Pragmatism over hype** ‚Äì ship iterative, reliable systems over ‚Äúperfect‚Äù solutions.
4. **Collaboration matters** ‚Äì mentor juniors, review code, and build consensus.
5. **End-to-end ownership** ‚Äì I own performance, reliability, and business impact.

---

‚ö° **One-liner summary:**
I‚Äôm not just an ML model tinkerer ‚Äî I‚Äôm an **AI systems engineer** who can design, deploy, and scale intelligent applications, with measured results and peer-reviewed engineering practices.

üëâ This way, you now have:

* **Startup pitch version** (flashy, broad)
* **FAANG interview version** (rigorous, depth + metrics + collaboration)

Do you want me to also make you a **‚Äútalking points cheat sheet‚Äù** (2‚Äì3 bullets per project, with metrics + tradeoffs) so you can **recall under pressure** in interview loops? That‚Äôs usually the best prep tool.
