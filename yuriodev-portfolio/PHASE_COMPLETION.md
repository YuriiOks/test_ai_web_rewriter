# Migration Progress Verification

This document confirms the completion status of the YuriODev portfolio migration roadmap.

## Phase 0 – Foundation & Environment Setup
- Vite React TypeScript scaffold with ESLint configuration is in place (`package.json`, `tsconfig*.json`, `eslint.config.js`).
- Boilerplate content cleared and global styling defined via `src/assets/styles/_variables.css` and `src/assets/styles/global.css`, imported in `src/main.tsx`.
- Project directories structured under `src/` with dedicated folders for `components`, `hooks`, `services`, `data`, and `assets`.

## Phase 1 – Layout & Hero Components
- `Header` and `LeftSidebar` implemented with CSS Modules in `src/components/layout/` providing responsive navigation and keyboard bindings.
- `HeroSection` encapsulates hero copy, JSON profile block, and CTA buttons with typewriter text from the reusable hook.
- `App.tsx` composes layout primitives and hero within the `CommandPaletteProvider` for page assembly.

## Phase 2 – Data-Driven Sections
- `src/data/projectsData.ts` and `src/data/skillsData.ts` export structured data sets that drive UI rendering.
- `ProjectCard` and `SkillTerminal` components accept data props to render individual entries.
- `ProjectsSection` and `SkillsSection` map over the data arrays to output responsive grids/terminals.

## Phase 3 – Interactivity & Advanced Logic
- `CanvasBackground` component renders the animated matrix canvas backdrop using `useEffect` and `requestAnimationFrame`.
- `useTypewriter` hook encapsulates hero text animation logic.
- `InteractiveTerminal` powered by `terminalService.ts` delivers command execution and session history.
- `CommandPaletteContext` and `CommandPalette` provide global ⌘K search/accessibility, integrated with header controls.

All roadmap phases are completed and reflected in the codebase.
